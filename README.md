🧩 What Is This Project?

Code Evaluation Orchestra is an AI-agent-inspired coding interview practice platform.

It allows a user to:

Select a coding problem

Read a clear problem statement

Write a solution in an editor

Receive automated evaluation with:

Test case results

Score

Technical analysis

Interview-style summary

The system simulates how multiple AI agents collaborate to evaluate a candidate during a technical interview.


❓ Why This Problem Matters

Students and job seekers often struggle to understand:

Which edge cases they missed

Whether their logic is interview-ready


🧩 Sponsor Tool Usage

⚡ Stormbreaker Deployment (Vercel)
Used to deploy and host the platform quickly and reliably.

🧠 Infinity Build (Cline CLI)
Used conceptually for rapid ideation, problem structuring, and iteration.
How their solution would be judged by a real interviewer

Code Evaluation Orchestra focuses on clarity of feedback, not just correctness.

| AI Agent           | Responsibility                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Test Generator** | Defines problem-specific test cases |
| **Code Analyzer**  | Detects solution logic patterns     |
| **Evaluator**      | Scores solution quality             |

🏁 Results & Impact

Provides clearer feedback than basic pass/fail systems

Mimics real interview evaluation

Improves learning through explanation, not just answers
