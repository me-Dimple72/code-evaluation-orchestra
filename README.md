🚀 Overview

Code Evaluation Orchestra is an AI-agent-inspired coding practice and interview evaluation platform.
Users choose a problem, write a solution, and receive structured, interview-style feedback instead of only pass/fail results.

The project simulates how multiple AI agents collaborate to evaluate code — similar to how real interviewers assess solutions.
