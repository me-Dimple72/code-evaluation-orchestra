🚀 Overview
<br> 
Code Evaluation Orchestra is an AI-agent-inspired coding practice and interview evaluation platform.
Users choose a problem, write a solution, and receive structured, interview-style feedback instead of only pass/fail results.
<br> 
The project simulates how multiple AI agents collaborate to evaluate code — similar to how real interviewers assess solutions.
<br><br> 
❓ Problem Statement
<br>
Learners often struggle to understand:
<br>
-What logic was missing
<br>
-Which edge cases failed
<br>
-Whether their solution is interview-ready
<br>
Code Evaluation Orchestra addresses this gap by emphasizing clarity, feedback, and explanation.

### 🤖 AI Agent Architecture

The system is designed as a collaborative multi-agent workflow:

| Agent          | Responsibility                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Test Generator | Provides problem-specific test cases            |
| Code Analyzer  | Inspects solution logic patterns                |
| Evaluator      | Assigns a score based on correctness            |
| Summarizer     | Generates interview-style feedback              |

Together, these agents produce a single, clear, and understandable evaluation for the user.
