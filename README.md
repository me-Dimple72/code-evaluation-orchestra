🚀 Overview
<br> 
Code Evaluation Orchestra is an AI-agent-inspired coding practice and interview evaluation platform.
Users choose a problem, write a solution, and receive structured, interview-style feedback instead of only pass/fail results.
<br> 
The project simulates how multiple AI agents collaborate to evaluate code — similar to how real interviewers assess solutions.
<br><br> 
❓ Problem Statement
<br>
Learners often struggle to understand:
<br>
-What logic was missing
<br>
-Which edge cases failed
<br>
-Whether their solution is interview-ready
<br>
Code Evaluation Orchestra addresses this gap by emphasizing clarity, feedback, and explanation.

🤖 AI Agent Architecture (Conceptual)
<br>
The system is designed as a collaborative agent workflow:

Agent	Responsibility
Test Generator	Provides problem-specific test cases
Code Analyzer	Inspects solution logic patterns
Evaluator	Assigns a score based on correctness
Summarizer	Generates interview-style feedback

Together, these agents produce a single, understandable evaluation for the user.
